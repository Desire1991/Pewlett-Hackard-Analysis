**# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**

_### **Overview:**_
The purpose of this project is to summarize the employee data in different ways to help the HR decision making process at Pewlett Hackard ("PH") using SQL. There are two major questions to answer through this Project:
1.	How many employees are retiring by title?
2.	How many employees are eligible for the mentorship program?
**Results**
Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
The table below shows the summary of employees who are retiring by title.
•	25916 Senior Engineer
•	24926 Senior Staff
•	9285 Engineer
•	7636 Staff
•	3603 Technique Leader
•	1090 Assistant Engineer
•	2 Manager

The result shows that the majority of retiring staff are of senior titles.
Among all employees, most people have technical skills, reflected by the "Engineer" and "Technique Leader" title.
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
The table below shows the summary of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program, based on their birthday.
•	78 Assistant Engineer
•	155 Staff
•	569 Senior Staff
•	77 Technique Leader
•	501 Engineer
•	169 Senior Engineer

It appears that non-technical staff account for a bigger portion of this cohort, compared to the retiring cohort.
Almost half of these people are already of senior titles, who may not need or want a mentor.
_**Summary**_
•	Using birthdays that fell between 1/1/1951 and 12/31/1955 to define people who are about to retire, there will be 72,458 roles that need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
•	Using birthdays that fell between 1/1/1965 and 12/31/1965, there are 1,549 current employees people who are eligible to be mentored. This number is dwarfed by the number of retiring employees.
To help offer more insight on the situation, I've used two additional queries to further refine the analysis.
